Backwards, forwards but making no ground at all 
Standing in the city with the clocks counting one 
And your face is still wet from the night before
 As your tears hit the ground blue flowers spring from them Baby,
 I'm ashamed of the things I put you through Baby,
 I'm ashamed of the man I was for you
 And all you said in your quietest voice was I needed you as much as they do 
And all you said in your quietest voice was I needed you as much as they do 
How fast must we run Before we can just take off in flight? How far must we run
 Before they do not recognize us? So let's take this from the start You'll be me and I'll be you 
And let's try not to complain about your smoking And my distant heart, and my distant heart, and my distant heart
 And all you said in your quietest voice was I needed you as much as they do And all you said in your quietest voice was I needed you as much as they do Too many mirrors in this house And I don't like to see myself like this I'm becoming the man I used to be I guess these walls could tell you a thing or two Things that you really don't want to know Lend me your eyes for your point of view Lend me your feet and I'll stand by you And all you said in your quietest voice was I needed you as much as they do And all you said in your quietest voice was I needed you as much as they do
