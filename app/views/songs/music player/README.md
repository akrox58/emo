This is almost definitely the first javascript/html mp3 player which can load music from your hard drive and parse id3 tags.

[Try it out online](http://antimatter15.github.com/player/player.html) it should work on the latest version of chrome and possibly safari. Chromium and firefox 4 will probably only work with ogg vorbis files. Internet explorer 9, mobile safari and opera will almost definitely not work.
